      <p>
        Scorpia, althoughÂ fromÂ the Horde,Â is a very caring and steadfast friend,
        in addition to being a determined Force Captain. She acts chiefly on
        behalf of her loyalty, shown in <span>'Perils of Peekablue'</span>, when
        she stays behind so that everyone else could leave; by then, she'd
        switched to fighting for the Rebellion. Scorpia, although her innocent
        and bubbly demeanor, sheâ€™s is ruthlessly cleaver. As demonstrated in
        episodes like <span>â€˜Princess Promâ€™</span>, and the
        <span>'Perils of Peekablue'</span> <br />
        <br />
        Scorpia has a fear of lightning, which is ironic given her Runestone.
        She is very chatty and energetic, her upbeat spirits are always there to
        keep things lively. She is a people pleaser and will do anything for
        others even when it is wrong. She describes herselfÂ as a "hugger" and
        loves to make friends. Throughout the show, protecting her friends is
        her main motivation.<br />
        <br />
        However, Scorpia can be very self-conscious and hard on herself. She has
        mentioned that the other Princesses were made uncomfortable by her and
        she feels judged by them. Scorpia copes with her insecurities and doubt
        with daily affirmations and her favorite mantra;
        <span
          >"I am brave, strong, loyal, and I give great hugs. And I am going to
          be the best friend I can be!"</span
        >
