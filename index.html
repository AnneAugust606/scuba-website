      <p>
        Scuba diving is a mode of underwater diving where the diver uses
        a self-contained underwater breathing apparatus (scuba), which is
        completely independent of surface supply, to breathe underwater. Scuba
        divers carry their own source of breathing gas, usually compressed
        air, allowing them greater independence and freedom of movement
        than surface-supplied divers, and longer underwater endurance
        than breath-hold divers. Although the use of compressed air is common, a
        mixture of air and oxygen called enriched air or nitrox has become
        popular due to its benefit of reduced nitrogen intake during long or
        repetitive dives. <br />
        <br />
        Scuba diving may be done recreationally or professionally in a number of
        applications, including scientific, military and public safety roles,
        but most commercial diving uses surface-supplied diving equipment when
        this is practicable.<br />
        <br />
        Also, a 2011 study conducted by Johns Hopkins University found,
        “veterans with spinal cord injuries who underwent a four-day scuba-
        diving certification saw significant improvement in muscle movement,
        increased sensitivity to light touch and pinprick on the legs, and large
        reductions in post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptoms.” In
        addition to the scientific findings, we’ve heard firsthand from hundreds
        of disabled divers telling us they feel less anxiety, fewer headaches,
        and a feeling of freedom that was previously missing from their life.
        We’ve seen vets with PTSD change from emotionally shut down and
        compartmentalized to open and engaged. Underwater, divers experience
        weightlessness, and for those suffering from severe injuries, this can
        make a huge difference - reducing swelling, taking pressure off joints,
        and reducing back and neck pain. Our divers tell us being underwater
        helps them filter everything out and just breathe.
